WEEK 1:

you are supposed to run the START.m firstly

TASK 1: To run the GetData.m to get data( max and min size, form factor and the filling ratio)

TASK 2: To run the Split_into_validation

TASK 3: To run this task (that is in Color folder) you have to use the function ColorSegmentation.m

TASK 4: Run Task4.m in the task4 floder

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEEK 2:

you are supposed to run the START.m firstly

TASK 1: You can run Use_operators.m and input one kind of morphological operators for testing, to see the results of different kinds of  morphological operator

TASK 2: You can run comparisonImages.m and choose to use different kinds of the morphological operator to get the results. It will also compare them with the results of using matlab functions; Also, you can run comparisonTime.m to campare and measure the computational efficiency of the programed operators (erosion and dilation) with the operators in matlab  

TASK3: To see the results in task3, you can display a mask_image, and then call a function named MorphologicalTransform.m to make the morphological transform. finally you can compare the before mask_image and the after one

TASK4: The HistBGProjection function calculate the histogram backgrond projection in HSV colorspace (chanel H) for a given  RGB image using a given histogram (100 bars) and threshold as input; and you can run the HistogramHSV.m to calculate the histogram backgrond projection for a given image using a given histogram and threshold as input.
